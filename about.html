        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>People love free steam games, no doubt.
            But what many people hate is downloading so many parts and trying to install them on their own. 
            This is why we are the only site that pre-installs every game for you. 
            We have many categories like shooters, action, racing, simulators and even VR games! We strive to satisfy our users and ask for nothing in return.
            We revolutionized the downloading scene and will continue being your #1 site for free games.
